# NYC Restaurant Mapper

by Ivan Chowdhury

## Project Description

This webpage allows you to enter up to 5 different food preferences or restaurant names that you're searching for. The search terms entered will all be searched through Yelp simultaneously. Then, the best-match results will be plotted on a Google Map of New York City. Each marker has attached an image of the restaurant, along with a link to its Yelp profile for further information.

## Instructions

In order to use the restaurant mapper, all you need to do is load the page, choose up to five restaurant names or kinds of food you're looking for, then fill out the form and press submit. The map will take a few seconds to load, depending on your internet connection.


Here is an example list of possible search terms: 

- Subway
- McDonalds
- Burger King
- Chipotle
- Ramen
- Seafood
- Vegetarian
- Mediterranean
